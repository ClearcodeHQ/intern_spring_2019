## Task 1 - CSV Report Processing

An important part of the operations of an AdTech platform is making sure metrics reported by different systems don‚Äôt have significant discrepancies. These systems usually have peculiar report interfaces, so we need some automation to obtain data that we can compare.

We have an ad campaign where ads are displayed in multiple countries. A single ad view is called an impression and users click on ads. Ads are designed and targeted to maximize click to impression rate (CTR). CTR is calculated by dividing the number of clicks by the number of impressions and is usually written as a percentage.

A third-party ad server company offers CSV reports with daily impression numbers and CTRs for our campaign, aggregated per state (or any other ISO 3166-2 subdivision). Our system has reports aggregated by country.

Your task is to write a Python script that reads a CSV file of such third-party data. Based on standard input, the script should output a CSV file with a report aggregated by date and country.

Input format: UTF-8 or UTF-16 CSV file (with any kind of line endings), with columns: date (MM/DD/YYYY), state name, number of impressions and CTR percentage.
Output format: UTF-8 CSV file with Unix line endings, with columns: date (YYYY-MM-DD), three letter country code (or XXX for unknown states), number of impressions, number of clicks (rounded, assuming the CTR is exact). Rows are sorted lexicographically by date followed by the country code.

If the input file has errors, appropriate error messages should be written to the standard error (stderr). An output CSV should be produced if the errors are not critical (if it‚Äôs not clear which ones are critical, the solution should include an explanation of your reasoning).

### Tips:
* UTF-16 has a byte order mark, otherwise it would be ambiguous. Just like UTF-8, it has a variable width, but this detail shouldn‚Äôt be noticeable in the solution.
* While a single date represents different times in different regions, here they are all UTC.
* Region names and codes used are provided by https://pypi.org/project/pycountry/
* We use Python 3.7; you can use external libraries available on PyPI (like pycountry) if you submit a requirements.txt listing them with versions (these are output by pip freeze). If a different Python version is needed, please provide a Dockerfile setting up a proper environment for running the script.
* CSV isn‚Äôt standard and has many dialects, but here we can assume that all fields have no quoting, no commas and are separated literally by commas.

### What we'd like to see
* Readable code (consider comments and docstrings that would help understand and maintain it)
* Error handling

### Example
Example input:
```
01/21/2019,Mandiana,883,0.38%
01/21/2019,Lola,76,0.78%
01/21/2019,FƒÅryƒÅb,919,0.67%
01/22/2019,Lola,201,0.82%
01/22/2019,Beroun,139,0.61%
01/22/2019,Mandiana,1050,0.93%
01/23/2019,üê±,777,0.22%
01/23/2019,Gaoual,72,0.7%
01/23/2019,Lola,521,0.19%
01/24/2019,Beroun,620,0.1%
01/24/2019,Unknown,586,0.86%
01/24/2019,üê±,1082,0.68%
```
Example output:
```
2019-01-21,AFG,919,6
2019-01-21,GIN,959,4
2019-01-22,CZE,139,1
2019-01-22,GIN,1251,12
2019-01-23,GIN,593,2
2019-01-23,XXX,777,2
2019-01-24,CZE,620,1
2019-01-24,XXX,1668,12

## Task 2 - Web Crawler
Clarence got lost while surfing the internet. Help him find his way out by creating a map of the domain he is on.

Write a function `site_map(url)` that takes a site URL as an argument and creates a mapping of that domain as a Python dictionary.
The mapping should contain all the accessible pages within that domain. Every entry should consist of:
* key: URL
* value: dictionary with:
  * site title (HTML `<title>` tag)
  * links - set of all target URLs within the domain on the page but without anchor links

### Example
Confused? Worry not! Here is an example site with a map.

Unzip the example.zip file into some directory and enter it.
Run the following command `python3 -m http.server`. You are serving a website now!
Check if everything is okay by visiting the http://0.0.0.0:8000 URL.
If everything works you can run your program with following parameter and verify if it gives the correct answer.

```
>>> site_map('http://0.0.0.0:8000')
{
    'http://0.0.0.0:8000': {
        'title': 'Index',
        'links': {'http://0.0.0.0:8000/example.html', 'http://0.0.0.0:8000/site.html'}
    },
    ‚Äò'http://0.0.0.0:8000/site.html':  {
        'title': 'The Site',
         'links': {'http://0.0.0.0:8000/site/subsite.html'}
    },
    'http://0.0.0.0:8000/example.html': {
        'title': 'No links here',
        'links': set()
    },
    'http://0.0.0.0:8000/site/subsite.html': {
        'title': 'Looping',
        'links': {'http://0.0.0.0:8000/site/other_site.html', 'http://0.0.0.0:8000'}
    },
    'http://0.0.0.0:8000/site/other_site.html': {
        'title': 'Looped',
        'links': {'http://0.0.0.0:8000/site/subsite.html'}
    }
}
```
